# Factoring Numbers README

## Description
This program factors natural numbers into a product of two smaller numbers. The factors can be prime or composite.

## Usage
To use the program, follow these steps:
1. Prepare a file containing natural numbers greater than 1, with one number per line.
2. Run the program with the following command:
   ```
   factors <file>
   ```
   Replace `<file>` with the path to your file containing the numbers to factor.

## Output Format
The program will output factorizations in the format `n=p*q`, where `p` and `q` are the factors of `n`.

## Example
Input file:
```
15
21
35
```
Output:
```
15=3*5
21=3*7
35=5*7
```

## Execution Time
The program has a time limit of 5 seconds. It will be terminated if it hasn't finished within this timeframe.

## Dependencies
The program does not have any external dependencies and can run standalone.

## Note
The program does not guarantee prime factorization. Factors `p` and `q` can be prime or composite numbers.

## Repository
Ensure all scripts, source code, etc., are pushed to your repository for execution.

## RSA Laboratories
RSA Laboratories' problem of finding prime numbers `p` and `q` such that `n = p * q` is a subset of this task. While the program doesn't guarantee prime factors, it provides factorizations which might include prime factors.
